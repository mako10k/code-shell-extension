# MCP Shell Server VS Code Extension

This extension registers MCP Shell Server as an MCP server in VS Code so it can be selected from the MCP server list.

## Development

- Install dependencies in this folder: `npm install`
- Build the extension: `npm run build`

The server entrypoint is resolved from the extension's bundled dependency on `@mako10k/mcp-shell-server`.
